> A blazing fast static files-serving web server. :zap:

**Static Web Server** is a very small and fast production-ready web server to serving static web files or assets.

## Features

- Built with [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) which is focused on [safety, speed, and concurrency](https://kornel.ski/rust-c-speed).
- Memory safety and very reduced CPU and RAM overhead.
- Blazing fast static files-serving powered by [Warp](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp/) `v0.2` ([Hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/) `v0.13`), [Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) `v0.2` and a set of [awesome crates](./Cargo.toml).
- Suitable for lightweight [GNU/Linux Docker containers](https://hub.docker.com/r/joseluisq/static-web-server/tags). It's a fully __5MB__ static binary thanks to [Rust and Musl libc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/platform-and-target-support/musl-support-for-fully-static-binaries.html).
- Opt-in GZip, Deflate and Brotli compression for text-based web files only.
- Compression on demand via [Accept-Encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) header.
- [Cache Control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) headers for assets.
- [HEAD](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.2) responses.
- Lightweight and configurable logging via [tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing) crate.
- [Termination signal](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Termination-Signals.html) handling.
- [HTTP/2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540) + TLS support.
- Default and custom error pages.
- [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) support.
- Configurable using CLI arguments or environment variables.
- First-class [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) support. [Scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch) and latest [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine) Docker images available.
- MacOs binary support thanks to [Rust Linux / Darwin Builder](https://github.com/joseluisq/rust-linux-darwin-builder).
