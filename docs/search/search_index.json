It is focused on lightness and easy to use principles but keeping high performance and safety powered by The Rust Programming Language . Written on top of Hyper and Tokio runtime. It provides concurrent and asynchronous networking abilities as well as the latest HTTP/1 - HTTP/2 implementations. It's cross-platform and available for Linux , macOS , Windows and FreeBSD ( x86 / x86_64 , ARM / ARM64 ) as well as Docker . Tips If you're looking for v1 please go to 1.x branch. If you want to migrate from v1 to v2 please take a look at v2.0.0 release. Features \u00b6 Built with Rust which is focused on safety, speed and concurrency . Memory safe and very reduced CPU and RAM overhead. Blazing fast static files-serving and asynchronous powered by latest Hyper , Tokio and a set of awesome crates . Single 4MB (uncompressed) and fully static binary with no dependencies ( Musl libc ). Suitable for running on any Linux distro or Docker container . Optional GZip, Deflate or Brotli compression for text-based web files only. Compression on demand via Accept-Encoding header. Partial Content Delivery support for byte-serving of large files. Optional Cache Control headers for assets. Termination signal handling with graceful shutdown ability and grace period. HTTP/2 + TLS support. Security headers for HTTP/2 by default. HEAD responses. Lightweight and configurable logging via tracing crate. Customizable number of worker threads. Optional directory listing. CORS support. Basic HTTP Authentication. Default and custom error pages. Configurable using CLI arguments or environment variables. First-class Docker support. Scratch and latest Alpine Linux Docker images available. Ability to accept a socket listener as a file descriptor for use in sandboxing and on-demand applications (E.g systemd ). Cross-platform.

However this project try to keep away of any kind of breaking change as possible between major versions. But it still supports and prioritizes \"no breaking changes\" for minor and patch (bug fixes) versions. In the other hand, if a breaking change is found to be \"strictly necessary\" to do. Then a new major version must be promoted as well as users informed accordingly in order they can do a seamlessly transition.","title":"Breaking changes"},{"location":"configuration/command-line-arguments/","text":"Command-Line Arguments \u00b6 The server can be configured via the following command-line arguments.
